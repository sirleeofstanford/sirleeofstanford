# 👋 Hey, I'm Lee Stanford

Welcome to my GitHub — a living lab of infrastructure, scripting, and joyful stewardship.

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Linux Systems Engineer and CyberSecurity Professional with a passion for building resilient, teachable infrastructure. My work spans:

- 🧱 Blockchain technologies
- 🧠 Programming and scripting (Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Solidity, and Java)
- 🔐 CyberSecurity and forensic diagnostics
- 🌐 Webhosting and virtualization (Hyper-V, WSL, WireGuard, OpenVPN, Docker,& Podman)
- 🧬 Semantic trust logging and recovery-ledger design

## 🛠️ What I'm Working On

- Restoring global IPv6 identity across my home lab
- Building contributor-ready PowerShell scripts for Hyper-V sanity
- Scaffolding semantic trust ledgers for every diagnostic
- Launching `hyperV-scripts-by-lee-&-copilot` — a repo born from whiteboard battles and adapter chaos
- Developing ssh_keygrid_AD: A project to pivot Active Directory towards running over ssh_host_based identities and authentication, with evolving secondary concepts for domain management.
- Building my homelab into a DataCenter.

## 🤝 Collaboration

I’m always open to collaborate — whether it’s infrastructure, scripting, or just bouncing ideas. If you’ve got a project, a puzzle, or a plan, I’ll lend a hand however I can.

## 📫 How to Reach Me

Email, phone, text — I even accept letters, telegrams, pigeons, and dispatches (though those last four are becoming scarce 🐦).

## 😄 Pronouns

He/Him — but I’ll respond to just about anything, even “Hey you.”

## ⚡ Fun Fact

I’m an Aquarius, a semantic event tagger, and a whiteboard warrior. Every fix is a story. Every script is a lesson.
